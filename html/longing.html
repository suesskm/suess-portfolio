        <h3>Longing for a Place <br>
        Exhibition</h3>
       
        <p><i>Longing for a Place That Doesn't Exist</i> is based on a personal essay dealing with issues of growing up and coming to terms with leaving things behind, whether they be tangible or emotional. The narrative reflects on the inevitability of change, the passage of time, and the profound impact of familial relationships on one's sense of identity. 
            <br><br>
            The printed book explores these themes by carefully curating a collection of photos, postcards, and notes and bringing them a new life by displaying them in a thoughtful and engaging way that allows readers into a glimpse of my family and childhood, and hopefully inspires others to engage in this type of thinking with their own experiences. 

            Included with the exhibition is a shadow box collage filled with trinkets and mementos that helped inspire the project. 
        <br><br>
            The exhibition was held in the Skylight Gallery at NEIU and ran from April 15th through April 30th of 2024.

<b>Audience</b>
<br>
This project was created with the intention to drive and inspire others to elicit in a similar type of thinking when it comes to relinquishing in the past. Exploring memories through objects, and exploring your own sense of identity through memory. This project seeks to contemplate the impact of one’s past on their present and future, as well as how individuals might navigate this influence of past memories and experiences. 
<br>
Most importantly, this project serves as a personal journey for me to reflect on my past and pave the way for a brighter future.

    <b>Objective</b>
    <br>
   <i>What is the “place that doesn’t exist"?</i><br>
Is it a home? Or is it a feeling? Is it family? Is it a place that I feel like I belong to but I don’t have roots there anymore?


The place that doesn’t exist, doesn’t have a definitive answer. But it is an answer to describe the way I’ve been feeling for the past five years. It’s a way to channel all of my misdirected emotions and questions about my place in the world and where I belong. 

The title reflects the universal experience of longing for a sense of belonging and familiarity that may no longer be attainable.
It raises questions about the nature of home, belonging, and the ever-changing landscape of personal identity.
